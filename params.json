{"name":"PlumpXP","body":"# PlumpXP\r\n\r\nA fairly simple bukkit plugin to achieve a few odds and ends:\r\n\r\n1. Multiply XP drops from all mobs (=> reduce XP farming)\r\n2. Multiply XP drops from blazes (=> make blaze farms less OP)\r\n3. Change player XP drops to be a fraction of total XP (=> rather than being limited/derpy)\r\n\r\n##Config\r\n\r\n* plump-multiplier - multiplies all mob XP drops\r\n* blaze-multiplier - multiplies blaze XP drops. NB: also multiplied by first field; use 0.5 to bring in line with other hostile mobs\r\n* player-override - whether or not to override vanilla player xp drop behaviour\r\n* player-multiplier - multiplier for player XP drops. A value of 1.0 will transfer all XP on player death\r\n\r\n##Commands\r\n\r\nPlayers with the plumpxp.reload permission can use /reloadplumpxp to reload config.\r\n","tagline":"Bukkit plugin to increase XP drops from mobs","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
